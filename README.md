# SimpleScriptingScript
Script for Space Engineers.

A script for parsing simpler commands so that it becomes easier to make scripts in SE.
Probably gona call in FLIP.

The simpler syntax would be something like this!
if(
[FLIP test door].Open=true,
){
[FLIP test light].OnOff_On
}else{
[FLIP test light].OnOff_Off
};
